Allows WooCommerce product category images to be displayed in a WordPress widget.  

== Description ==

The default WooCommerce Product Categories widget is unable to
display product category images. This plugin creates a new widget that
adds the following features that the default plugin lacks.

* option to display category as text only, text with image, or image only.
* specify the size of the category thumbnail to be displayed.
* specify an *optional* CSS ID if you need to style the list differently from other lists.
* specify one or more CSS classes to make use of your theme's existing style.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I style the category images to look a certain way? =

You would need to know how your theme works and how to use CSS to
style the categories.

= Why aren't images displayed when categories are displayed as DropDown? =

The default WooCommerce Product Categories widget does not do that
also. For the time-being, we won't be implementing this feature
because it requires extra Javascript and other usability
considerations for mobile users.

= Any more documentation on this plugin? =

I'm working on it. Give me some time. Thanks.

= Where is the PO or MO file for translation? =

I foresee the plugin undergoing quite a lot of changes for some time before it 
is stable. That's because I have some features that are already done but not included
in this version of the plugin yet. So I'll add the PO/MO file when things are more stable.

= Is the plugin's code on GitHub? =

Not at the moment but it will definitely be there. I  need some time to test and 
clean up the code before I put them there.

= What does the XO10 mean? =

To me, it means lots of things but I'll talk about them another day. For now, just take
it that it sounds like my WordPress username - *saltern*. And is also what I use 
as a unique namespace prefix for all plugins that I write.
